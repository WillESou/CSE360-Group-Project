# CSE360-Group-Project

Group Project for Group 52 - Thursday Session

Phase 2 Deliverable code in main branch. The program is initiated through Source.java, and all other classes flow out of it.
For the purpose of grading, the main branch is the final deliverable of the project. The other branches are for us to use later in case we need to.
